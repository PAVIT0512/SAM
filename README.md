## Initial Round: The Quiz

Our journey commenced with the initial round—a challenging quiz on robotics, automation, and Flipkart. 📚 With perseverance and dedication, we not only participated but excelled, clearing the first hurdle with flying colors. 🌟

## Designing SAM: Singulation Automation Machine

As we progressed to the subsequent round, tasked with designing an innovative automation machine for box picking, our collaborative efforts surged. We delved into prototyping and 3D printing, conceptualizing our solution, the **Singulation Automation Machine (SAM)**. 🛠️ 

The core idea revolved around a dynamic 3D motor-controlled CNC mechanism, featuring a rotating arm and a suction cup at the bottom of the z-axis, enabling precise box manipulation. Additionally, our design incorporated a second module facilitating the seamless flipping of boxes, ensuring labels were positioned on top before dispensing. 📦

Triumphantly, we conquered the second round, earning the esteemed spot as finalists at IIT Madras. 🏆 Special thanks for which goes to the EV Research Center, where we diligently worked on our project, utilizing the available facilities. I extend my heartfelt appreciation to Mr. Imran Baig and Mr. Shahid Khan for their invaluable contributions, cooperation, and technical support during the prototype-building phase. 🙏 Additionally, I acknowledge the pivotal role played by Idea Labs and the Mechatronics Lab in converting our ideas into a tangible prototype.

## Preparation and Final Showdown

From August 1st, 2023, until the final showdown at IIT Madras on January 5th, 2024, we dedicated our efforts, refining our models and preparing diligently. 📅 Competing among 19 teams from prestigious institutions such as IIT Bombay, IIT Roorkee, and more, we secured the honorable position of second runner-up, proudly representing our college and achieving significant acclaim. 🥈

## Acknowledgments

Participating in this challenge has been an enriching experience, fostering learning, teamwork, and innovation. 🌟 I owe a debt of gratitude to our college for providing us with the support and resources necessary to thrive in such endeavors. The environment here has been a nurturing shield, encouraging us to push boundaries and excel. 🎓
